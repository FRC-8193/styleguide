# FRC 8193 Style Guide

This repository defines the official coding style and conventions for **FRC Team 8193**.  
The goal is to keep our codebases **clean, consistent, and easy to read** across all projects.

## Contents
- [C++ Style Guide](cpp.md) — naming rules, indentation, brace style, and class structure.  

More languages and tooling guides may be added over time.

---

## How to Use
- When writing code for team projects, follow the rules in this style guide.  
- Consistency matters more than personal preference — the team wins when our code looks the same.  
- If you’re unsure about a rule, check the guide. If it’s not covered, open an issue or PR here.

## Why a Style Guide?
- Makes code easier to read and review.  
- Reduces "friction" when multiple people edit the same project.  
- Helps new members onboard quickly.  
- Professional teams use style guides — so should we.
